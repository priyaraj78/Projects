Wrote bash shell script that takes the information below as input on the command line as
arguments or reading interactively from the user if the input isn’t provided on the command line
as an argument. Both methods are supported. For the interactive run, the user is prompted to let them know what to input. If the user provides an argument, then I can
assume all arguments is there.
Following are the conditions I kept in mind:
● User ID or username (either should be accepted as valid input)
○ Must validate the UID or username as one that exists on this system
○ Exit with a descriptive error message if it does not exist
● Group ID or group name (either should be accepted as valid input)
○ Must validate the GID or group name as one that exists on the system and that
the user provided is a member of that group
○ Exit with a descriptive error message if it does not exist
● Absolute path of the directory to search in
○ Must validate the path to ensure the directory exists
○ Must validate that it is an absolute path
○ Exit with a descriptive error message if it does not exist

An output file is created called “acl_files.txt” in the “project” directory within my home
space. The output file has one entry per file or directory as described below.
Each entry has the following fields. The fields is separated by a colon.
● Absolute path of the file or directory
● Permissions of the file (all permissions in the form they are displayed by the “ls -l”
command)
